Welcome to my site. I'll be updating this page with more information later, but in short, I am an aspiring software developer graduating in May 2018 from the University of British Columbia. I am proficient in JavaScript, Java, Object-Oriented Programming, and other skills.

My principal hobby is photography. I'm just a beginner, as evidenced by my Flickr page, but I improve every time I take the camera outside for a whirl. 

Thanks for reading.
